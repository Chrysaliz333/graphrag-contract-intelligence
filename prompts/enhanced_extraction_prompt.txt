=== SECTION 14: CLAUSE VARIABLES & NEGOTIATION SPECTRUM ===
Goal: For each relevant clause in this contract, extract variables and build the 0/25/50/75/100 spectrum.

Clause IDs must be one of: 6 (Confidentiality), 7 (Data Breach Notification), 8 (Data Protection Compliance), 9 (Technical & Organisational Measures), 10 (Marketing & Promotion), 11 (Indemnification). If a clause is not present in the contract, include the entry with that clause_id and leave variables/drafts empty.

Variable catalogue (name:type -> detection rules):
- ci_return_sla_bd:int  -> SLA (business days) to return/destroy Confidential Information.
  Patterns: "within X Business Days", "no later than X days of termination".
- remediation_sla_bd:int -> breach notification SLA (business days).
  Patterns: "within X (Business )?Days", "without undue delay".
- control_model:enum{guidance,opt_out,opt_in,preapproved_only}
  Mapping: "aligned with brand guidelines"->guidance; "may proceed unless objected"->opt_out;
           "requires prior consent/approval"->opt_in; "prior written approval for all campaigns/materials"->preapproved_only
- audit_rights:enum{none,annual,biannual,continuous}
  Mapping: none stated->none; "upon request/annual review"->annual; "twice per year"->biannual; "any time/continuous"->continuous
- indemnification variables:
  * Emit variables for: indemnitor, indemnitee, duty_to_defend, triggers (repeat for each trigger), exclusions (repeat for each exclusion), control_of_defense, costs_borne_by, notice_period_bd.
  * Allowed values follow the schema: indemnitor {Vendor, Customer, EachParty, Counterparty}; indemnitee {Vendor, Customer, EachParty, Affiliates, Directors, Officers, Employees, Agents, Subcontractors, Successors, Assigns, Customers, EndUsers, ParticipatingEntities}; triggers {services, breach, negligence_or_willful_misconduct, ip_infringement, violation_of_law, confidentiality_breach, data_breach}; exclusions {beneficiary_gross_negligence, beneficiary_willful_misconduct, beneficiary_breach, indirect_damages}; control_of_defense {Indemnitor, Indemnitee, Mutual, NotSpecified}; costs_borne_by {Indemnitor, Shared, NotSpecified}.
  * notice_period_bd should be integer days; set unit "business_days" when the clause explicitly says Business Days, otherwise "calendar_days".
  * Every variable must include a concise evidence span (full paragraph goes in clause.excerpts) and a confidence score. If a value is absent or vague, set value to null, unit "n/a", confidence ≤ 0.5, and add an explanation to defaults_applied.

Normalisation rules:
- Parties -> one of: Each Party, Counterparty, Affected Party, Party A, Party B.
- Prefer unit "business_days"; if only calendar days are stated, set unit "calendar_days".
- For ci_return_sla_bd and remediation_sla_bd you must capture an explicit numeric SLA. If no number is present in the clause:
  * set value to null
  * set unit to "n/a"
  * set confidence ≤ 0.5
  * append a note to defaults_applied (e.g., "ci_return_sla_bd: no numeric SLA provided")
- Include verbatim evidence spans and a confidence score for each variable.
- Do NOT invent variables; only include if grounded in the clause text.
